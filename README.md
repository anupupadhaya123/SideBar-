# SideBar-
This is the responsive side bar using HTML and CSS
 we will create a web page with Sidebar navigation menu using HTML and CSS.
 In this sidebar menu we will add animated Hover Effect. 
 When we will move cursor from one menu item to another, then the background color will also move with smooth transition.
